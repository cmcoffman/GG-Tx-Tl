We tried putting the output of a Golden-Gate assembly reaction directly into a Tx-Tl reaction.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("analysis.R")
```

##Results
Here is a plot of the GFP emission over time:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(gg.txtl.plot)
```

##Interpretation
The blank and 1st rep showed no response over time. The 2nd rep showed a slight increase over time, but the background was high. Maybe its not mixed well?
